[Bestselling Author Store Website](https://gsg-k1-fc.github.io/team2-real-story/)‚Äè

## The Purpose
We created this web page as a first project required to complete the fundamentals Course of Web development offered by Gaza Sky Geeks Academy, and it's a landing page for a website built using html and css .

## What is this website?
It's a landing page for an author's website, which contains a basic information about him and his books.

## How did we do it?
We worked on the project as a group of 3 members, and each one worked on a specific section as follows:
- **[Sarah](https://github.com/sarah-alsharif0)** : did the **Header** section which contains the *Navbar* and the *Hero* section.

- **[Nesma](https://github.com/anaal)**: did the **Bio** section which contains an image for the author and information in two columns about him.

- **[Montaser](https://github.com/MontaserSaleh91)**: did the **Contact** and the **Footer** section which contains means of communications and Social media for the author.
